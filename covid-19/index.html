                    <p>Within 24hrs of your appointment, you'll receive a phone call from Laura.  This is to ascertain the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>is there a need for a face-to-face consultation? - would a remote/video consultation be better suited to your needs?</li>
                        <li>do you, or any one in your household, currently have covid-19 symptoms (a new dry, persistent cough? high temperature? loss of taste or smell?) or have any of you tested positive in the last 7 days?</li>
                        <li>do you, or anyone in your household, suffer from respiratory symptoms such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD)?</li>

                    <h2>The Homevisit Itself</h2>
                    <p>For the time-being face-to-face appointments will be limited to 30 minutes and not all of this time may be spent with you.  For example, some of the time may be spent taking your case history during the pre-screening phone call, or writing up your file notes.  Please rest assured that the full appointment time will be spent on you, but just may not be directly in front of you. </p>
                    <p>Laura will phone you to announce her arrival, at the agreed time of your appointment.  In line with government guidelines, let's do the following:</p>

                            <li><em>Please clear the room of people</em> that don't need to be there.  Of course, if you'd prefer a chaperone or you're the parent/guardian of the patient, then please stay but otherwise, let's limit the number of people at your appointment</li>
                            <li><em>Please have a clean pillow and towel</em> to hand if you'd like to lie on them, on the bare treatment table</li>
