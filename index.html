                    <h2>About Osteopathy</h2>
                    <p>To qualify, an osteopath must study for four to five years for an undergraduate degree.  This is similar to a medical degree, with more emphasis on anatomy and musculoskeletal medicine, and includes more than 1,000 hours of training in osteopathic techniques.</p>
                    <p>Osteopathic treatment does not only target symptoms but treats the parts of the body that have caused the symptoms. Osteopaths have a holistic approach and believe that your whole body will work well if it is in good structural balance.  Using a wide range of techniques, including massage and joint mobilisation, the osteopath’s breadth of approach enables a focus on every patient’s precise needs.</p>

                    <h2>What can I expect?</h2>
                    <p>Laura will go through a thorough medical history with you.  This will include questions in relation to your symptoms and your physical activities, as well as some questions related to your general health.  At this stage, Laura will also establish whether it is appropriate to examine you.</p>
                    <p>Physical examination will involve observation, palpation (assessing the tissues through touch) and movement.  Information gathered from the case history and examination form the basis of Laura's diagnosis and treatment plan.  Depending on the location of your symptoms, some level of undress may be required.  Therefore, please feel free to bring shorts or vest to change into.</p>
                    <p>Treatment itself generally consists of soft tissue massage, muscle energy techniques and joint articulation/manipulation.  She may also offer advice on hot/cold, stretching and exercises.  Laura has the benefit of time with her patients and so she can try to answer any health-related queries and offer appropriate advice.</p>
                    <p>People respond differently to osteopathic treatment.  Some may feel relieved and energetic; others tired and achey.  Laura always encourages her patients to contact her should anything cause undue concern.  The number of treatment sessions required will vary depending on the nature of your problem.  It can be difficult to predict but she always tries to keep it to a minimum.</p>
                    <p>She allows up to 1 hour for an initial consultation and usually 30 minutes for any subsequent appointments.</p>

                    <h2>A little bit about us</h2>
                    <h4>Laura Faithfull, Registered Osteopath</h4>
                    <p><!-- my bio -->I first went to an Osteopath as a three year old, accompanying my older sister who was in need of help.  To this day, my parents still see that same Osteopath.  Growing up with osteopathy combined with a natural curiosity of how our bodies function and an inquisitive mind, made becoming an Osteopath a natural step.</p>
                    <p>Whilst training to be an Osteopath, I completed a sports massage course and subsequently, created Climbers Clinic in one of London's climbing walls, The Castle.  After qualifying in osteopathy a decade ago, I decided to make Edinburgh my home, fuelled by a love of the hills.</p>
                    <p>Nowadays, I don't climb so much (too busy using my hands to treat patients) instead I love hill running and road cycling.</p>
                    
                    <div id="sarah"><h4>Sarah Emslie, Clinic Manager</h4></div>
                    <p><!-- Sarah intel -->I was a keen swimmer as a twelve years old but sadly my back was sore, so that's when I first went to an Osteopath.  I was working in Financial Services before realising I wanted to train in osteopathy.</p>                        <p>Having worked as an osteopath for a decade, it was sadly time for me to hang up my clinic coat and become the Clinic Manager.</p>
                    <p>When not runnning the clinic, I love road cycling (even started dabbling in time trialling) and running in the hills</p>
